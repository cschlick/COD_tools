A set of scripts to filter the [COD](http://www.crystallography.net/cod/) database for use as a molecular training set.


## Installation
First install [phenix fragments](https://github.com/cschlick/phenix_fragments)
Then, install additional dependencies into the same environment
```console
conda install -c conda-forge mdanalysis
```
MDAnalysis/RDkit are used to infer bond orders

## Usage

### Get the full dataset using rsync
```console
mkdir COD
cd COD
mkdir -p cif
rsync -av --delete rsync://www.crystallography.net/cif/ cif/
```

This will take a while. It downloads a large number of small molecule structure files in a .cif text format. These files contain information about the xray experiment and data, information about the atom coordinates, and information about the bonded atom pairs.
